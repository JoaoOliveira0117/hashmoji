# Emoji hashing algorithm

Developed on Data Structures class at Feevale University

## What is this?

A simple implementation of the hashing algorithm using emojis instead of traditional unicode calculations.

## How does it work? 
It calculates the sum of the unicode characters in each word of the `../public/text.txt` file, then generates the corresponding emoji and maps it on the HashTable class.

## Limitations?
There are only 80 spaces availables for different words.
